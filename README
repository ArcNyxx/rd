rd - privilege elevator
=======================
rd is a simple privilege elevator for the Linux model of password storage.

Requirements
------------
rd requires libcrypt to verify passwords. If this feature is disabled, libcrypt
is no longer required.

Installation
------------
rd comes with a Makefile and config.mk file for configurable building and
testing.  Edit the latter to match your local setup (rd is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default, you may need to modify your $PATH).

rd can be built and installed with the following command (run as root):

    make clean install


Configuration
-------------
rd can be configured by directly editing rd.c and (re)compiling the source
code.  Furthermore, multiple macros can be defined in config.mk to configure
build options.  This keeps it fast, simple, and secure.
